DataProvider - allow to perform DDT (data driven testing)
    testing same functionality with different sets of data
    data and code are independent. If make any changes in the data our code in test does not get affected
groups in TestNG - allow to group test cases:
        based on type of testing (smoke, regression, database etc)
        based on the functionality( login, search, payment etc)
        based on sprint (sprint5, sprint 6, sprint7 etc )
Listeners - is feature that listens/tracking to any events that happens during test execution:
        test starts
        test pass
        test fail
        test skipped
        test finished
