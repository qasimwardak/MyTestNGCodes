TestNG is annotation based tools/frameworks
@Test - is a main annotation and it marks our method as Test method
TestNg has annotation for precondition that is define with @Before(method, class)
TestNg has annotation for postcondition that is define with @After(method, class)

TestNG Parameters:
- priority
    priority = 0 --> is set by default
    priority = 1 --> we are defining a priority of the test
- enabled
    enabled = true --> is a default behaviour
    enabled = false --> if we want to skip specific test
- dependsOn
    we can create Test methods that will depend on others.
    In case of failure depended method will be skipped/ignored from the execution
Assertions in TestNG (validation)
- (Hard Assertion) Assert Class
    Assert.assertTrue
    Assert.assertEquals
- (Soft Assertion) -
    SoftAssert softAsert=new SoftAssert();
    Soft assert collect all failures but does not throw an exception
    at the end we need to call method .assertAll();
